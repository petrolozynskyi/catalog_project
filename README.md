## Description
Products catalog [this design](https://www.figma.com/file/uEetgWenSRxk9jgiym6Yzp/Phone-catalog-redesign?node-id=1%3A2).

This project is a phone catalog web application built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

# Technologies Used:
- HTML: Provides the basic structure of the web page, including elements like headings, paragraphs, and containers for the React components.
- CSS: Styles the visual appearance of the application, including elements like buttons, text, and layout. Common use cases involve:
  - Defining the overall layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox for a responsive design.
  - Applying fonts, colors, and backgrounds to create a visually appealing interface.
  - Styling specific React components to match the desired look and feel.
- React: Manages the dynamic UI elements and handles user interactions. Key functionalities include:
  - Creating reusable components for different parts of the phone catalog (e.g., phone list item, individual phone details).
  - Managing the state of the application (e.g., currently selected phone, filtered list).
  - Rendering the UI based on the current state and user interactions.
